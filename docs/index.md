# Sybil Setup Documentation

### About

[Sybil](https://github.com/reginabarzilaygroup/Sybil) is a Lung Cancer Risk Prediction model.
It can be used to score a series of DICOM images and predict the risk scores for a given DICOM Series.
An implementation can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/reginabarzilaygroup/Sybil).

While the model is easy to use, integrating it into a hospital environment is not trivial.
This documentation provides instructions on setting up Sybil on arbitrary environments.
