Most questions are already covered here:</p>          Could we observe real time utilization of sybil to gain an intuitive understanding to assist during discussions with hospital IT?           We would be happy to provide a screen capture of using Sybil on an iMac at our lab.               What security events are logged for access and for data modifications? Can this information be provided in an audit trail report?           No events were logged when we used Sybil in our lab. This could be implemented via a script, for example in Python.               Do you have a network diagram showing the software/hardware components, architecture, and communication and data flow?             All steps are performed on the machine where Sybil is installed. A more detailed description can be found in the guide we shared previously.               Does the software or data need to be backed up or retained for compliance?             We did not create any back ups when using Sybil at our lab. From our side, no backups or logging are required.               How are users\u2019 access permissions assigned and controlled? (Is users\u2019 access to the software role-based.)           Sybil is installed within Docker as a regular application on the machine, therefore each user on the device can access Docker and Sybil.               What type of authentication is used for users\u2019 access to the software? (Active directory, application credentials, local user, none, other?)           No authentication was required when we used Sybil at our lab, but this could be implemented.               Is any data stored locally on the users\u2019 devices?           Yes, the data analyzed by Sybil and the output are stored on the device where Sybil is installed.               Is any data stored or processed outside of Hospital networks?           No data is sent outside the device where Sybil is installed.               How is the software patched/updated for vulnerabilities?           Sybil was developed and updated as needed by Dr. Barzilay\u2019s group at MIT.               Does the software: process(send/receive), store, access, or display ePHI (patient data) or other data subject to regulation?             In our lab, we used Sybil to process CT scans containing patient data. It should also be possible to run Sybil on anonymized CT scans from which patient data was removed.               If the software does not store patient data, how would we link each data set (CT scan and sybil out)?               If running Sybil on anonymized CT scans, one option would be to replace the accession number with another unique identifier. This could be implemented via a script."}]}
